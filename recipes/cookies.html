    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup (142g) light brown sugar, <em>packed</em></li>
        <li>2/3 cup (131g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (92g) vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt (use 1/2 teaspoon salt if you use salted butter)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract, <em>optional</em></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cider vinegar or white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups (240g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>2 cups (340g) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the sugars, butter, shortening, salt, vanilla and almond extracts, vinegar, and baking soda, beating until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Beat in the egg, again beating until smooth. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl with a spatula to make sure everything is thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Mix in the flour, then the chips.</li>
            <li>Use a spoon (or a tablespoon cookie scoop) to scoop 1 1/4" balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving 2" between them on all sides; they'll spread.</li>
            <li>For enticing salty-sweet flavor, sprinkle a touch of sea salt atop the cookies before putting them in the oven, if desired.</li>
            <li>Bake the cookies for 11 to 12 minutes, until their edges are chestnut brown and their tops are light golden brown, almost blonde.</li>
            <li>Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool on the pan until they've set enough to move without breaking. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Store cookies, well wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days; freeze for longer storage.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
